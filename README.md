# NNANO 2.0
NNANO 2.0 is an environmental engineering project designed to neutralize nitrogen oxides (NOx) from power plant exhausts, converting them into reusable water and safe byproducts through a sequence of controlled chemical reactions. The system combines oxidation, condensation, and neutralization processes in an airtight chamber monitored by a pH sensor and automated NaOH release mechanism.

Originally developed for the Technology Student Association (TSA) competition, the project was later refined to improve chemical efficiency, automation, and scalability. We added a more accurate pH monitoring system, improved membrane separation, and ensured a completely sealed prototype to replicate real-world exhaust conditions.

Our chemical verification experiments followed a stepwise process of converting NO to NO₂, forming HNO₃ through reaction with water and oxygen, and neutralizing it with NaOH to produce NaNO₃ and H₂O. The final solution reached a near-neutral pH (~6.5), confirming safe repurposability for industrial use.

This process and its underlying chemistry were reviewed and validated by Dr. Sreekanth Kokkonda, a chemist at the University of Washington, who advised us on reaction optimization, safe nitric acid handling, and improving the overall neutralization mechanism.
